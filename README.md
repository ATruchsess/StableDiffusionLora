SDXL LoRA for Bar & Line Charts

This repository contains a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model trained on a dataset of bar charts and line charts for use with Stable Diffusion XL. The goal of this project is to showcase the process and effectiveness of LoRA training for generating specific, structured data visualizations.


About the Model

This LoRA was trained on a autogenerated dataset of several thousand images of bar charts and line charts. Â´
Key Features:

    Generates both bar charts and line charts as a style reference.

This project serves as a proof-of-concept for training LoRA models.


To use this LoRA, you'll need a compatible Stable Diffusion XL setup (like AUTOMATIC1111's Web UI or ComfyUI).

    Download the LoRA file (.safetensors) from the releases page.
    Place the file in your Stable Diffusion models/Lora directory.
    In your UI, include the LoRA in your prompt using the syntax: <lora:your_lora_filename:weight>

Recommended Settings:

    LoRA Weight: 0.7 to 1.0 is a good starting point. Higher weights will adhere more closely to the trained style.
    Prompts: Use descriptive prompts to guide the image generation.

Example Prompts:

    A vibrant bar chart showing population growth over 10 years, data visualization, infographic style, clean design
    A detailed line chart tracking stock market trends, blue and green lines, dark theme, financial data
    An artistic interpretation of a bar chart, watercolor style, abstract data representation
